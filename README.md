# webscraper_practice
webscraper for gamestop/amazon/etc

I made this since the game my brother really wants is usually out of stock.
I wanted a way to track websites that doesn't email you when its back in stock (i.e gamestop)


Goals:

probably implement classes at some point. Would make everything nicer/clean

flesh out a timer/email system. Timer is easy, I need to look into the email part

Maybe push it onto my node.js site? 

Ideas:

I can make a price vs. time graph using the data I collect while web scraping.
